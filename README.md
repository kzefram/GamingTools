This program is to showcase all I have learned through the course. For example: Loops, TryParse, Controls, and math.

This a form where you can play or use as a tool for curiosity. There is a math guessing game, a statistics game and a Heads or Tails guessing game. For the math game, the user enters 2 operands, selects an operator and inputs a guess in the text box. When they click Check, it will display whether the guess was correct or not.
The statistics game generates random numbers, displays them in the list box, and displays  the count, average, minimum and maximum numbers.

Finally the Heads or Tails guessing game has the user click on Heads or Tails radio button and it will display a randomly generated coin toss and display if the guess was correct along with the total number of guesses, total number of correct and incorrect guesses.
